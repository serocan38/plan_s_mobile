/// Templates - Atomic Design Layer 4
/// 
/// Templates are page-level objects that place components into a layout
/// and articulate the design's underlying content structure.
/// 
/// Templates consist mostly of groups of organisms stitched together
/// to form pages. It's here where we start to see the design coming together
/// and start seeing things like layout in action.
